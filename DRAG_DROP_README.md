# Room Calendar Drag & Drop Functionality

## Overview
The room calendar now supports drag and drop functionality, allowing users to move bookings between different rooms and dates seamlessly.

## Features

- **Drop**: Drop the booking on any available cell (room + date combination)
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Dragged items show with reduced opacity
  - Drop zones highlight in blue when hovering
  - Smooth animations during drag operations

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Interactions
